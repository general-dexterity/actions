          You are checking if the agent documentation files are up-to-date with the codebase.

          ## Files to check
          ${{ steps.find-docs.outputs.files }}

          ## Your task
          1. Read each documentation file listed above
          2. Explore the codebase to understand the actual structure, commands, and conventions
          3. Compare the documentation against reality
          4. Determine if any documentation is outdated, missing information, or incorrect

          ## What to check for
          - Directory structure matches what's documented
          - Commands listed actually work (check package.json scripts, Makefile, etc.)
          - File paths and patterns mentioned still exist
          - Conventions described match actual code patterns
          - Any new important files/directories that should be documented

          ## Output
          If documentation is accurate: Report that no updates are needed.

          If documentation is outdated: ${{ inputs.create-issue == 'true' && 'Create a GitHub issue with:' || 'Report:' }}
          - Title: "Update agent documentation: [brief description]"
          - Body: Specific items that need updating, with suggested changes
          - Label the issue with "documentation" if creating one

          Be specific about what's wrong and what the fix should be.
